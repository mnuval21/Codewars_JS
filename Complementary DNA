Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

DNAStrand ("ATTGC") // return "TAACG"

DNAStrand ("GTAT") // return "CATA" 

Test.assertEquals(DNAStrand("AAAA"),"TTTT","String AAAA is");
Test.assertEquals(DNAStrand("ATTGC"),"TAACG","String ATTGC is");
Test.assertEquals(DNAStrand("GTAT"),"CATA","String GTAT is");

function DNAStrand(dna){
  //a = dna.toUpperCase();
  let compDNA = '';
  for(let i = 0; i < dna.length; i++){
    if(dna[i] === 'T'){
      compDNA +='A';
    }
    if(dna[i] === 'A'){
      compDNA += 'T';
    }
    if(dna[i] === 'C'){
      compDNA += 'G';
    }
    if(dna[i] === 'G'){
      compDNA += 'C';
    }
  }
  return compDNA;
}
